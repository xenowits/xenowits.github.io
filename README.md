  The current repository has been taken from the fourth iteration of <a href="https://brittanychiang.com" target="_blank">brittanychiang.com</a> built with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/" target="_blank">Gatsby</a>.
</p>

### Deployment

- Make changes in the `source` branch
- Run `npm run deploy`. This will build and push to `master` branch automatically.

NOTE: The `source` branch is made default because only the changes which are made to `master`
are pushed to github-pages. So, `source` branch contains our actual gatsby code whereas `master`
branch is the deployment branch.
